# Ada Jump Start: CANDY MACHINE ASSIGNMENT
# - Overview- 
# This challenge is to build a computer candy machine. Youâ€™ve got some money and you want to buy some candy. 
# So, you go up to the candy machine, put in your money, select your candy, and then pick up your candy and your change. 
# You can use gets.chomp to get input from the user without the extra newline at the end.

# - Requirements -
#    1. Ask the user how much money they have, assume that the $ symbol is part of the prompt (the user doesn't have to enter it)
#    2. Display all candy options and their costs (even if the user cannot afford the candy)
#    3. Decide whether the user can afford the candy or not, if they can't, tell them so, if they can, calculate and display their change
#    4. [Optional] Handle when the buyer enters "C" or "c" so that it works as expected
#    5. [Optional] Do something appropriate when the buyer enters an invalid amount for the money and an invalid selection

# 1. Ask the user how much money they have, assume that the $ symbol is part of the prompt (the user doesn't have to enter it)
# 5. [Optional] Do something appropriate when the buyer enters an invalid amount for the money and an invalid selection - Utilizing .to_f to store as float. If input is string or nil it will store as 0.00
print "How much money do ya got? > $"

# If user has more than $2 tell them "that' alot!" otherwise tell them "that's all?"

C $0.75 Nutter Butter
D $0.65 Peanut Butter Cup
E $0.55 Juicy Fruit Gum\n "
